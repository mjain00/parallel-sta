# Parallel Static Timing Analysis - Final Project for 15618 Spring 2025

**URL:** [https://mjain00.github.io/parallel-sta/](https://mjain00.github.io/parallel-sta/)

## Summary
Our project focuses on performing **static timing analysis** on circuits to identify if they violate **setup and hold time constraints**. In this project, weâ€™ll leverage **task-based parallelism** to efficiently provide fast and thorough analysis on complex circuitry.

## Proposal
Here is our project [proposal](proposal.pdf).
